        Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,<br>
Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.<br>
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments<br>
Will hum about mine ears; and sometime voices,<br>
That, if I then had waked after long sleep,<br>
Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,<br>
The clouds methought would open, and show riches<br>
Ready to drop upon me; that, when I waked,<br>
I cried to dream again.<br>
